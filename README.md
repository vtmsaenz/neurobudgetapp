# NeuroBudget: Emotion-Aware Cashflow Tracker

A mobile-first personal finance application that helps users understand their true cashflow across multiple accounts while tracking the emotional patterns behind their spending habits.

## 🎯 Problem It Solves

Most budgeting apps track what you spend, but not why you spend—or how credit cards, BNPL, and multiple accounts distort your sense of "how much money I actually have." NeuroBudget helps users (especially those with ADHD or emotional spending patterns) see true cashflow across multiple accounts, tag each expense with an emotional state/trigger, and surface patterns that lead to overspending.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Secure Authentication** - JWT-based auth with Spring Security
- **Multi-Account Tracking** - Bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and savings
- **True Cashflow Calculation** - Factors in upcoming bills, credit balances, and minimum payments
- **Emotion & Trigger Tagging** - Tag purchases with emotional states and spending triggers
- **Transaction Import** - CSV upload with auto-categorization
- **Insights Dashboard** - Visualize spending patterns by category, emotion, and trigger
- **Smart Alerts** - Notifications for unusual spending and upcoming bills

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
- React Native with TypeScript
- Expo for simplified development and testing
- React Navigation for routing
- Axios for API calls
- React Native Chart Kit for visualizations
- AsyncStorage for local caching

### Backend (Java Spring Boot)
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3 (Web, Security, Data JPA)
- Spring Security with JWT authentication
- PostgreSQL database
- Flyway for migrations
- Docker support

### DevOps
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Docker containerization
- Cloud deployment (Render/Railway/Fly.io)

## 📱 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Java 17+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- PostgreSQL (or use Docker)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd neurobudget
```

2. **Start the backend**
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

3. **Start the mobile app**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

4. **Run on your device**
- Install Expo Go on your phone
- Scan the QR code from the terminal

## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### Architecture
- RESTful API design with Spring Boot
- JWT authentication and authorization
- React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- PostgreSQL for relational data modeling

### Key Technical Decisions
- Why JWT over session-based auth
- Multi-account cashflow calculation algorithm
- Emotion tagging data model and insights generation
- CSV parsing and duplicate detection strategy

### What I'd Improve Next
- Real bank API integration (Plaid/Yodlee)
- WebSocket notifications for real-time alerts
- Machine learning for spending pattern prediction
- Biometric authentication
